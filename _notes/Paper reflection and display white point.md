Or the visual match

The key is the paper reflected white point and how to measure it.

In Spectrashop, select Emissive-Light

after calibration, DON't put the ambient cap on

measure the paper reflected white \**

Osram for EPPPSG: 0.3361 0.3452, or 5344K (20210701 Reflected Osram EPPPSG spectrashop file)

In the EIZO ColorNavigator app, you can't specify x,y coordinates as white point. You can start with a colortemperature, create a profile and then manually / visually finetune the whitepoint using Advanced / manually adjust












Note: this is also how the Eizo measures the paper reflection when using Advanced / paper
