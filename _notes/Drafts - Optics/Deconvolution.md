What is deconvolution?

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution
In mathematics, deconvolution is the operation inverse to convolution. Both operations are used in signal processing and image processing. For example, convolution can be used to apply a filter, and it may be possible to recover the original signal using deconvolution.

In optics and imaging, the term "deconvolution" is specifically used to refer to the process of reversing the optical distortion that takes place in an optical microscope, electron microscope, telescope, or other imaging instrument, thus creating clearer images. It is usually done in the digital domain by a software algorithm, as part of a suite of microscope image processing techniques. Deconvolution is also practical to sharpen images that suffer from fast motion or jiggles during capturing. 

How does it work?
Define the blur characteristics (see [[Point Spread Fuction]]) and use it to remove that particular blur from an image

Is it really that simple?
No. Challenges include the definition of the PSF, the presence of noise in the image, the fact that the PSF is not identical for all parts of the image
