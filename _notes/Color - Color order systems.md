###### Definition, classification and main applications



In 1905, A. H. Munsell argued that color needed a system [[

</a>p8::rmn]]to get rid of terms like peacock blue, Nile green and royal purple because such weak definitions invited mistakes and disappointment. He made it very clear: color definition badly needed a consistent basis.



With his book “A Color Notation”, the concept of color system or color order system was born. [[
Munsell was not exactly the first researcher attempting to systematically define colors. See the note on [Munsell Color System](https://festive-bhabha-073837.netlify.app/notes/munsell-color-system) for more on the color system itself and on it's predecessors.::rmn]]


##### What is a color order system?
A color order system does exactly what it says on the tin: it orders colors, and does so in a systematic way. The colors receive a label reflecting their position in the order.



In many cases the color system colors are printed and published in a book or in a tree-like structure, called a color atlas or fan. [[

##### What is it used for?
Color order systems have two main applications:
1.  Give unambiguous names to colors, thereby precisely defining a color;
2.  Enable the selection of three or more equidistant colors


##### What types of color systems do we have?

Looking at the way color systems are set up, they come in three flavors. The most widely-used systems order the colors by color appearance and define the colors based on hue, lightness and chromaticity. The colors in this category are spaced in a visually uniform, or equidistant, way. The gold standard in this category is the Munsell color order system. The Natural Colour System (NCS) and the RAL system are other well-known appearance-based color systems.



The second type of color order system is based on stepwise variation of colorants. The Pantone system is an example of this category.



The third type is based on variation of pigment, white and black. The most popular in this category is the Ostwald colour system. Adoption however does not seem as wide as the Munsell, RAL and, to a lesser extent, Pantone systems.
