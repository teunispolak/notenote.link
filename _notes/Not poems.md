This line from the artilleryman in The War of the Worlds [[
Wikipedia: [The war of the Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds)::rmn]]
is probably the best description of my digital collection of notes, thoughts, ideas, theories and post-its. Almost all of the stuff I've tried to wrap my head around was to understand things from a theoretical point of view. Why are things working like they are? Or, as Fokke and Sukke [[
Wikipedia: [Fokke & Sukke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokke_%26_Sukke)::rmn]]wondered: does it also work in theory?

Back to our artilleryman. He is quite clear on how he wants to rebuild civilization after it was defeated by the Martians. Underground, and science-based, as per the lyric 
in Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds:[[

We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks right under their noses - right under their feet! Everything we need - banks, prisons and schools...
We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and men like you'll teach the kids.

_Not poems and rubbish - science, so we can get everything working._

We'll build villages and towns and... and... we'll play each other at cricket!::wrap]]


The artilleryman's song above is based on the following fragment from the original book:
[[
Wikisource: [The War of the Worlds](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds/Book_2/Chapter_7). I never realized that The War of the Worlds was written between 1895 and 1897.::rmn]]

[[
<br>There is a persistent and funny story about a 1938 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds causing a panic among the audience. True or not, the story is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%281938_radio_drama%29)

It's saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing. There men like you come in. There's books, there's models. 

We must make great safe places down deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry swipes, but ideas, science books. 

That's where men like you come in. We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through. Especially we must keep up our science â€” learn more.::wrap]]


Hmm... "There's books, there's models" - that would have made a nice title as well!
