In 1905, A. H. Munsell argued that “color needs a system” [[

</a>p8::rmn]]to get rid of terms like peacock blue, Nile green and royal purple as such weak definitions invited mistakes and disappointment. The point he made was clear: color definition badly needed a consistent basis.



With his book “A Color Notation”, the concept of color system or color order system was born. [[
Munsell was not exactly the first researcher attempting to systematically define colors. He stood on the shoulders of many others but was not very forthcoming about that. See the note on [Munsell Color System](file:///"Users/teunis/notpoemsandrubbish/\_notes/Munsell%20Color%20System.md") for more on the color system itself and on it's history.::rmn]]



A color order system does exactly what it says on the tin: it orders colors, and does so in a systematic way. The ordered colors receive a label reflecting their position in the order.



In many cases the ordered colors are printed and the patches are published in a book or tree-like structure, called a color atlas or fan. [[

Color order systems have two main applications:
1.  Give unambiguous names to colors, thereby precisely defining a color;
2.  Enable the selection of three or more equidistant colors



Looking at the way color systems are set up, they come in three flavors. The most widely-used systems order the colors by color appearance and define the colors based on hue, lightness and chromaticity. The colors in this category are spaced in a visually uniform, or equidistant, way. The gold standard in this category is the Munsell color order system. The Natural Colour System (NCS) and the RAL system are other well-known appearance-based color systems.



The second type of color order system is based on stepwise variation of colorants. The Pantone system is an example of this category.



The third type is based on variation of pigment, white and black. The most popular in this category is the Ostwald colour system. Adoption however does not seem as wide as the Munsell, RAL and, to a lesser extent, Pantone systems.
