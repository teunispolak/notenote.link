The strength of flour is represented in protein (gluten) quality and quantity. This varies greatly from flour to flour. The quality of the protein indicates the strength and stability of the flour, and the result in bread making depends on the method used to develop the gluten by proper handling during the fermentation. Gluten is a rubber-like substance that is formed by mixing flour with water.  Before it is mixed it contains two proteins. In wheat, these two proteins are and

. Although we use the terms _protein_ and _gluten_ interchangeably, gluten only develops once the flour is moistened and mixed. The protein in the flour becomes gluten.

Hard spring wheat flours are considered the best for bread making as they have a larger percentage of good quality gluten than soft wheat flours. It is not an uncommon practice for mills to blend hard spring wheat with hard winter wheat for the purpose of producing flour that combines the qualities of both. Good bread flour should have about 13% gluten.

The Gluten Protein

Gluten is a large protein made by the joining of two other proteins: glutenin and gliadin. A ﬂour which is high in protein is high ingluten and therefore desirable for its structure and textural attributes which it gives in baked products. The Biuret Test looks for the presence of peptide bonds and thus proteins. In wheat, we know this protein is gluten
