Blistering is really just a cosmetic feature which you either like or you don’t. It’s most commonly seen on sourdough breads, but you can also get blistering on any loaf that has built up more acidity. A long fermentation is one way to achieve this, even when using commercial yeast. Steam during the first part of the bake also encourages blister formation, while adding flour to the surface discourages it.
