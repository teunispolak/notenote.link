### Aerobic Threshold

definitie: de heart rate die hoort bij je aerobe drempel  



#### Testing

**Stephen Seiler: Measuring Training Effectiveness** [1]

- max 2K test = 100% power
- step test @ 60, 70 and 80% of max power for 5 mins each  

  

 **Uphill Athlete: Aerobic Threshold Outdoor Test** [2]
- increase hart rate gradually 5 bpm every 3 mins
- when nose breathing becomes difficult, back off just enough to a sustainable nose breathing pace for 10-15 minutes. Note your heart rate at this pace! There is usually only a 2–4 bpm difference between easy breathing and unsustainable nose breathing.
- note: Some folks have trouble breathing through their nose. This AeT intensity we are looking for also corresponds quite well to the point at which you can no longer carry on a conversation by speaking in full, normal sentences.  

  

**Uphill Athlete: Heart Rate Drift Test** [3]

- Warm up for 15 mins with estimated aerobic pace
- Once your heart rate stabilizes for 2–3 minutes after at least a 15-minute warm-up, start the recording feature on your GPS watch.
- Record for 60 minutes while doing your best to keep your heart rate close to that initial heart rate number.
- Upload the data to TrainingPeaks.
- Open the workout in TrainingPeaks and click the “Analyze” button. In the window to the right of your workout graph you will see Pa:Hr X.XX%. This decoupling metric compares the pace-to-heart-rate ratio of the first half of the workout to that of the second half. Note the number and skip ahead to “Reading the Results.”
