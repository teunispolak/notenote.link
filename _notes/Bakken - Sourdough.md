## Some tough theory

Below is a chart for the L. sanfranciscensis lactobacillus and C. milleri yeast which both are common in sourdoughs. Commercial regular active yeast contains the species S. cervisiae. The type C. milleri is very common in sourdough breads and it does work better at lower temps, but S. cervisiae actually peaks it’s activity at about 35°C (95°F).

A few degrees difference in dough temperature can change the duration of the bulk fermentation or the final proofing a lot. When baking bread with regular active dried yeast, the optimum (for speed alone) temperature is just over 27ºC/80ºF.

Much hotter and the activity of the yeast declines. Above 35C/95F the yeast is effectively dormant or dead. The bacterial activity peaks at 34C/93F, so some bakers choose to ferment at 32C/90F to get a more sour bread. At 21C/70F the activity of the yeast has roughly halved, so the fermentation will take twice as long.

The right temperature is the single most critical variable. The growth rate of for example the L. sanfranciscensis lactobacillus and C. milleri yeast is ln2 / generation-time, i.e. a growth rate of 0,7 is a generation (doubling time) of about 1 hour.

If the generation time within your dough at 20ºC/68ºF is 1/2 of that at 30ºC/86ºF, the organism will also grow 1/2 as fast at 20ºC/68ºF compared to 30ºC/86ºF. So, it’s not the absolute numbers that matter, but the ratio of growth rate to growth rate at optimum temperature.

    Regular active yeast is the species S. Cervisiae, not C. Milleri. C. Milleri is very common in sourdough breads, and it does work better at lower temps, but S. Cervisiae actually peaks it’s activity at about 35°C (95°F). The chart you’ve presented looks like it’s based on the same data as that presented in Ginsberg’s The Rye Baker, and it does hold true for sourdoughs, but not for active dry yeast.

        Thank you Martin, for this helpful information. Based on this we will look into your suggestions and also update our article.

            I have seen that chart many times (I think it was from a paper by Gaenzle) & believe it is highly misleading and I try & challenge its use whenever I see it. The dominant yeast in sourdough is S. cerevisiae and as Martin states, this has a higher peak activity temperature than C. milleri and stays viable up to much higher temperatures. Also L. sanfranciscensis is not a major component of the lactobacillus species in most starters and often isn’t present at all! Have a look here to confirm: [robdunnlab.com/proje…dough/map/](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/sourdough/map/ "URL: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/sourdough/map/")

    This is awesome! Is the data from the chart of activity level vs temp available somewhere? I’d love to be able to make a quick excel sheet to adjust my timings based on temperature (my kitchen swings wildly so its hard to get a stable read)

        Hi Graham,  
        Very sorry, there was a site with info the chart was based on but we cannot seem to find it anymore. Hope you will still be able to fabricate an excel sheet to aid you with your challenging temp swings.
