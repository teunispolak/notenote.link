#### Goal
Upgrade to the highest possible version supported on OSX High Sierra, OSX 10.13.6

#### Steps
<br>

1. First, figure out which version is available for the installed version of OSX [^1]
2. Download via the link in [1] and install as indicated [^2]
3. Remove the old XCode version by moving it to Trash, then empty trash [^3]

Since you have to copy some info from the old XCode package content to the new app, keep the old app in place until the upgrade has been completed.
