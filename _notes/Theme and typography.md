Starting from the notenote.link template, I've made some adjustments to the layout.
[[[notenote.link](https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link) is a fork of the [simply-jekyll](https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll) theme::rmn]]
The underlying idea is to get full focus on the content, not on the layout - minimalism to the max.

[[The [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) theme documentation contains valuable configuration info::rmn]]

#### Body text 
Font size 15 px, line height 1.5. [[
Ref. [Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)::rmn]]

#### Sidenotes 
[[
Examples of sidenotes and margin notes can be be found [here](https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes)::rmn]]
I've adjusted the css file to get minmium distraction from the sidenotes (margin notes actually, because they're not numbered). When you hover the sidenotes the text beomes more visible and url's are underlined. Font size 10px, line height 1.5.

#### Headings
- h3 --> 19px
- h4 --> 16px
- All headings now 500 font-weight
